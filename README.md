# OOP-Basics
Welcome to my project which shows off Java's OOP abilities!
## What does this code show?
### Object oriented programming
As a newcomer to the world of programming, I find Object Oriented Programming in Java very clear and easy to understand.
Inside of the `src` folder we have our base `Plane.java` class. From that we created an instance in `App.java`. From `Plane.java` our classes `Jet.java` and `Helicopter.java` inherit. The subclasses share the superclasses attributes and methods but also have their own.
### Java
By using java, this project is "proof" that a newcomer like me is able to create java projects.
### Special casing
My use of casing in this project varies from camelCasing to PacalCasing to conform to java's code standards. 
### Git
Lastly, this project uses git to manage it's versions and keep backups of the code.
